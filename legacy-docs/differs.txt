Differences between FLL's language and MUCKer Forth:

  * See PRIMS.TXT for the list of supported primitives.

  * The only types supported are string and int.

  * notify  ( s -- )          Sends string s to stdout.

  * random  ( -- i )          Random number between 0 and 32767

  * subst   ( s1 s2 s3 -- s ) Substitutes S3 with S2 in S1.  It
                              is not implemented locally, and 
                              can be $included from test/subst.m

  * DOS only allows 127 characters maximum input to the 
    READ primitive.
  
  * The $include directive is implemented, but no others are.  All
    directives save $include are treated as single line comments.
    
    Compatibility $defines:
       
      $def notify me @ swap \notify
      $def dump
